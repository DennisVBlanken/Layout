	<h2>PokemonGO</h2>
	<p>Pokémon GO is a free-to-play augmented reality mobile game developed by Niantic for iOS and Android devices. The game was released in July 2016. The game allows players to capture, battle, train, and trade virtual Pokémon who appear throughout the real world. The game is free-to-play, although it supports in-app purchases. An optional wearable device that works alongside the game, called the Pokémon Go Plus, will be released in the future as a separate purchase. The device uses Bluetooth connection to notify users when a Pokémon is nearby with an LED display and light vibration.</p>

	<p>Players have to walk around in the real world to move their avatar in the game. Different Pokémon live in different areas of the world; for example, water-type Pokémon are found near water. When a player encounters a Pokémon, they may view it in either Augmented Reality mode or with a pre-rendered background. AR mode utilizes the camera and gyroscope on the player’s mobile device to display an image of a Pokémon as though it were in the real world. Players can also take pictures of the Pokémon using an in-game camera that they encounter both with and without the AR mode activated.</p>
